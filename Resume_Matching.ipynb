Worked on and executed afew of its algorithms using Python.●Developed multiple projects to get a better understanding of the concepts of MachineLearning.IndiaMART InterMESH LimitedInternJune’18-July’18●Worked for the m-site team which was responsible for the maintenance of IndiaMART’smobile website.●The m-site functioned using the Yii framework and the MVC model. Was introduced tothese.●Developed a demo application using CSS, HTML and Bootstrap.●Resolved a bug on the OTP screen in the Opera Mini Browser.TECHNICAL SKILLS●Operating Systems: Windows, Linux, MacOS●Programming Languages: C, C++, Javascript, Core Java, Advanced Java, Python, PHP,MySQL, HTML, CSS.●Introduction to the Amazon Web Services.●Machine LearningPROJECTSSegmentation and Classification of a Bank Customer’s Profile through Random Forests and aWide and Deep Neural Network. (Dissertation Project)June’20', '●In this project,the profiles of a large database of customers are divided andrepresented in order to group them with each group availing some common set ofbenefits and services.●Data-preprocessing is performed on the dataset sourced from the UCI MachineLearning Repository.●Classification is done firstly via the Wide and Deep Neural Network. It is also done viaRandom Forests.●It is implemented using the NumPy, Matplotlib, Sci-kit, Tensorflow libraries, Keras APIand Python Programming Language.Natural Language Processing through Sentiment Analysis. (Major Project)May’19●This project aims at classifying tweets from Twitter into “positive” or “negative”sentiment by building a model based on probabilities.●The analysis is performed through classification which is a Machine Learningtechnique. It crawls over Twitter collecting all tweets related to the user’s searchkeyword using the Twitter API.●This is followed by data pre-processing where the stop words or any unrelatedinformation is filtered. The formatted tweets are stored and are classified using theNaive Bayes’ Classifier.●Implementation was done by using the NLTK, NumPy and Matplotlib libraries and thePython Programming Language.Text Detection and Translation Application. (Minor Project)Dec’18●This android application focuses on retrieving the text from images captured by realtime camera and then converting it into text format and further translating it into thedesired language.●It is based on Optical Character Recognition and is developed using Google’s MobileVision framework and the Translation API.●The task is performed via photo scanning of the text character-by-character, analysisof the scanned-in image, and then translation of the character image into charactercodes.HONORS AND RESPONSIBILITIES●Member of the University Placement Cell, responsibilities included creating placementbrochures, profiles and contacting companies.●Organized an Event ‘Artificial Intelligence to Reality’ in TECHNOPHILIA Organized Under●NANOfIM 2017 (IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE).●Compered in various informal events of the college.●Member of the PR team for university’s cultural fest.●Active participation in literary events.●Secured first position in a Creative Writing Competition.']   \n",
